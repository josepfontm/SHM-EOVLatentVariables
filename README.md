# SHM-EOVLatentVariables

Code to reproduce paper results (or as close as possible, depending on data-availability). 
The scripts implement both latent variable methods and a conventional fully explicit EOV procedure to address environmental and operational variability in vibration-based SHM.

## Congress paper:

* [A latent variable approach for mitigation of environmental and operational variability in vibration-based SHM â€“ A linear approach (EWSHM, 2024)](https://www.ndt.net/search/docs.php3?id=29704)
  * Estimation of latent variables (DSFs and EOPs) of structures to obtain a comprehensive baseline model.
  * Avoid common issues with measured EOPs and DSFs: noise-influence, collinearity and/or acting EOPs not acquired during measurement.
  * Application to a [small-scale wind turbine blade](https://doi.org/10.1002/stc.2660).
  * Presentation in the EWSHM2024.
  * Code to process data from ETH Blade. (TO DO)
